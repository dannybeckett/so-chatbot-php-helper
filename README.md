This PHP helps [../SO-ChatBot](https://github.com/dannybeckett/SO-ChatBot).

Since we can't get non-[JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) data (e.g. XML) from another domain in JS due to [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), requests are proxied here instead.

Data is also retrieved from a MySQL database.
